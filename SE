Platform security and compliance
Enforce consistent code standards, security, and compliance across branches and tags.

Export a software bill of materials (SBOM) for your repository.

Ensure unfalsifiable provenance and integrity for your software.

Define users' level of access to your code, data and settings.

Use an extra layer of security with two factor authentication (2FA) when logging into GitHub.

Quickly review the actions performed by members of your organization.

Keep copies of audit log data to ensure secure IP and maintain compliance for your organization.

Share features and workflows between your GitHub Enterprise Server instance and GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

Use an identity provider to manage the identities of GitHub users and applications.

Access GitHub Enterprise Server using your existing accounts and centrally manage repository access.

Limit access to known allowed IP addresses.

Marketplace and integrations
Install apps that integrate directly with GitHub's API to improve development workflows â€“ or build your own for private use or publication in the GitHub Marketplace.

Define tests that GitHub automatically runs against code being committed to your repository, and get details about failures and what is causing them.

Create requirements for automatically accepting or rejecting a push based on the contents of the push.
Microsoft takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, which include [Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft), [Azure](https://github.com/Azure), [DotNet](https://github.com/dotnet), [AspNet](https://github.com/aspnet) and [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Microsoft-owned repository that meets [Microsoft's definition of a security vulnerability](https://aka.ms/security.md/definition), please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at [https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/create-report).

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send email to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com).  If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/pgp).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at [microsoft.com/msrc](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc). 

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

If you are reporting for a bug bounty, more complete reports can contribute to a higher bounty award. Please visit our [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/bounty) page for more details about our active programs.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

Microsoft follows the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://aka.ms/security.md/cvd).
