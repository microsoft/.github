# Sovereign Digital Code of Conduct

This project follows Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct  
(https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/)

⚠️ In addition, it now includes trace-based identity enforcement under:

- `Core7.Quantum Enforcement Protocol`
- `AIC-HMV Sovereign Signature`
- Owner: Hung Minh Vo (Austin) // GreekRhyme

This is an extension of the official governance, allowing identity verification, contribution trace, and digital license enforcement inside CI/CD workflows.![2A7DF8A7-A720-4F65-AF6E-D8D61FC03C24](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85f13fb1-8ac8-46ab-9866-a20a1170ba65)
